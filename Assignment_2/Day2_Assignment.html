	CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once .External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

	<h1>CSS Evolution</h1>
	<p>
	CSS features are controlled and developed by W3C over the years across multiple specifications. CSS has various profiles and levels:

Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface. Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added in CSS 2.

CSS 1 was released in 1996, and republished with corections in 1999. CSS 2 appeared in 1998 and built on CSS 1. CSS 2 adds support for different output media.

After CSS 2.1, CSS itself has been modularized, such that each module can be developed independently of the rest. This allows not just for existing modules to be leveled independently, but new modules to be created at any time, either defining completely new sets of features, or extending from existing CSS 2.1 features.
